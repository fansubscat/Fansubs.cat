     * Linebreaks4imagettftext is a function to automatically insert line breaks into
     * your text while using PHP's imagettftext function
     *
     * @param float  $size               <p>The font size. Depending on your version
     *    of GD, this should be specified as the pixel size (GD1) or point size
     *    (GD2).</p>
     * @param float  $angle              <p>The angle in degrees, with 0 degrees
     *    being left-to-right reading text. Higher values represent a counter-
     *    clockwise rotation. For example, a value of 90 would result in bottom-to-
     *    top reading text.</p>
     * @param string $fontfile           <p>The path to the TrueType font you wish
     *    to use.</p><p>Depending on which version of the GD library PHP is using,
     *    when fontfile does not begin with a leading / then .ttf will be appended
     *    to the filename and the library will attempt to search for that filename
     *    along a library-defined font path.</p><p>When using versions of the GD
     *    library lower than 2.0.18, a space character, rather than a semicolon, was
     *    used as the 'path separator' for different font files. Unintentional use
     *    of this feature will result in the warning message: Warning: Could not
     *    find/open font. For these affected versions, the only solution is moving
     *    the font to a path which does not contain spaces.</p>
     * @param string $text               <p>The text string in UTF-8 encoding.</p>
     *    <p>May include decimal numeric character references (of the form:
     *    &amp;#8364;) to access characters in a font beyond position 127. The
     *    hexadecimal format (like &amp;#xA9;) is supported.Strings in UTF-8
     *    encoding can be passed directly.</p><p>Named entities, such as &amp;copy;,
     *    are not supported. Consider using html_entity_decode to decode these named
     *    entities into UTF-8 strings.</p><p>If a character is used in the string
     *    which is not supported by the font, a hollow rectangle will replace the
     *    character.</p>
     * @param int    $maximumWidth       <p>The maximum width (in pixels) a line
     *    should be before adding a line break.</p>
     * @param int    $lineBreakCharacter <p>The character(s) to use when adding a
     *    line break (default is PHP_EOL).</p>
     *
     * @return string Returns a string that is nearly identical to $text; the only
     * difference is the newly added line breaks.
