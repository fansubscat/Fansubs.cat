# How to contribute


## Issues

When [filing bugs](https://github.com/cjrasmussen/BlueskyApi/issues/new),
try to be as thorough as possible:
* What version did you use?
* What did you try to do? ***Please post the relevant parts of your code.***
* What went wrong? ***Please include error messages, if any.***
* What was the expected result?


## Pull requests

Bug fixes and general improvements to the existing codebase are always welcome.
New features are also welcome, but will be judged on an individual basis. If
you'd rather not risk wasting your time implementing a new feature only to see
it turned down, please start the discussion by
[opening an issue](https://github.com/cjrasmussen/BlueskyApi/issues/new).


### Testing

Should there be tests for this?  Yes.  Am I lazy?  Also yes.  Am I going to hold 
someone to standards I don't hold myself to?  No.
